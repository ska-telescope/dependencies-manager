# dependencies-manager
Checks the minimum system and python packages dependencies for the ska-skeleton project

## Usage:
Build the docker image from scratch and get the system dependencies under `dependencies/REPOSITORY_NAME`:
```
> ./get-clean-deps.sh
```

## Principles
The dependencies for every of the ska-telescope repositories will be defined on what packages from different origins need to be added to a *base image*.

These packages are allowed to be installed through the following:
- the OS' package management tools, namely, `apt`
- from the python package index `PyPI` using `pipenv`

## Definition of *base project*
The base project is defined as the following
- python:3.5-slim docker image comprised of:
    - debian stable slim image
    - minimal python installation on top of debian stable slim image
- git tooling
- make
- pipenv

## Requests for adding packages to the *base project*
For the present, the System Team can be contacted in order to update the definition of *base project* and add new base dependencies to it.

## Defining dependencies to install
Each project is responsible to script the steps needed to build them and install their needed dependencies in the form of simple shell commands as expressed in the file `get-deps.sh`.

## Listing dependencies
The dependencies list extracted from running the too shall reside in `dependencies/PROJECT_NAME` and are he following:
- `lib_deps.txt`: the libraries installed in the OS and their associated packages
- `lib_deps_diff.txt`: the libraries installed in the OS and their associated packages that are not part of the *base project*
- `system_deps.txt`: the packages installed in the OS
- `system_deps_diff.txt`: the packages installed in the OS that are not part of the *base project*
- `system_deps.csv`: the packages installed in the OS in simplified CSV format
- `system_deps_diff.txt`: the packages installed in the OS in simplified CSV format that are not part of the *base project*
- `pipfile_deps.csv`: the packages expressly specified to install by `pipenv` (package sub dependencies are not part of this file) in simplified CSV format
- `pipenv_graph.txt`: the packages installed by `pipenv` including all sub dependencies
- `pipenv_graph.csv`: the top level packages expressly installed by `pipenv` (package sub dependencies are not part of this file) in simplified CSV format
